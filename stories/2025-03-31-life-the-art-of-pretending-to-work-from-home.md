# The Art of Pretending to Work From Home

A groundbreaking study published last week has confirmed what remote workers have known all along: the average professional spends approximately 42.7% of their work-from-home day perfecting the illusion of productivity rather than actually being productive.

The research, conducted by the Institute of Obvious Workplace Behaviors, found that most remote employees have developed an intricate system of tactics to appear busy while actually doing very little. These techniques include strategic keyboard tapping during Zoom calls, maintaining an "away" status that mysteriously changes to "active" seconds after receiving a direct message, and mastering the skill of sending emails at precisely spaced intervals to create the impression of consistent work.

"We've observed fascinating behaviors," explains Dr. Martha Reynolds, lead researcher. "For instance, many subjects have learned to move their mouse every 9-10 minutes to prevent their status from showing as 'away,' while simultaneously watching entire seasons of shows on another device."

The study also found that 65% of remote workers have a "panic button" setupâ€”the ability to quickly switch screens from social media to a spreadsheet when they hear the Zoom call connect sound. An impressive 82% admitted to having a "work voice" that's exactly 1.5 octaves higher than their normal speaking voice, reserved exclusively for surprise calls from management.

Tech companies have taken note, with several startups now developing sophisticated "productivity theater" tools. The most popular app, "BusyBee," allows users to schedule random keyboard sounds, occasional sighs, and pre-programmed phrases like "I'm just finishing that up now" to be deployed automatically throughout the day.

Corporate managers interviewed for the study insist they're not fooled by these tactics, right before admitting they've been in their pajama bottoms for the entire Zoom interview and were actually shopping online with their camera off.
