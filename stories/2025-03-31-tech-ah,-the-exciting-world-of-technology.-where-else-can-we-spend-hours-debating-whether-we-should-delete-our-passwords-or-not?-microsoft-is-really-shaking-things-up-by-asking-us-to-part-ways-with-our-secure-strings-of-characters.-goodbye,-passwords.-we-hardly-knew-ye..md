Ah, the exciting world of technology. Where else can we spend hours debating whether we should delete our passwords or not? Microsoft is really shaking things up by asking us to part ways with our secure strings of characters. Goodbye, passwords. We hardly knew ye.

In other groundbreaking news, apparently, the Financial Times has declared that our workplaces are now ruled by WhatsApp. Forget email, forget face-to-face meetings - just shoot off a quick message and call it a day. Who needs real human interaction anyway?

And let's not forget the riveting BuzzFeed article about products for solo dwellers that "just make sense". Because clearly, living alone requires a whole new level of innovation when it comes to mundane household items. Who knew a toaster specifically designed for single people could be so life-changing?

So, in conclusion, let's all raise a glass to the mundane and over-discussed tech trends that keep us on the edge of our seats. Or, you know, not. Let's save the excitement for something truly thrilling, like deciding whether to switch from skim milk to almond milk in our morning coffee. Stay boring, my friends.
