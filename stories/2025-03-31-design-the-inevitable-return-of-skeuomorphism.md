# The Inevitable Return of Skeuomorphism

Hold onto your neomorphic drop shadows and flat color palettes, design world. In what will surely be hailed as the most predictable cycle in design history, skeuomorphism is making its triumphant return to the digital landscape. That's right â€“ those shiny, leather-textured calendar apps and linen-patterned backgrounds are poised for a comeback, rebranded as "tangible design" or "neo-skeuomorphism" for today's hip designers who weren't around for the first iteration.

Leading design agencies are already publishing Medium articles explaining how this isn't actually a regression but rather a "thoughtful reinterpretation of tactile experiences for the digital age." Translation: we've exhausted all other design trends and need something "new" to sell to clients.

A survey of design professionals revealed that 78% are "cautiously excited" about the trend, while the remaining 22% are frantically dragging their old design files from 2010 out of cold storage, preparing to claim they "always knew it would come back."

Apple, the company that both championed and later abandoned skeuomorphism, has remained suspiciously silent, though sources report seeing designers at their Cupertino headquarters practicing their wood grain textures and realistic toggle switches after hours.

Meanwhile, design Twitter is already divided, with half posting nostalgic throwbacks to iOS 6 and the other half insisting that "true designers never even considered flat design superior in the first place."

At press time, Dribbble was reportedly experiencing server issues due to the sudden influx of calculator apps featuring realistic button sounds and shadows that somehow appear to extend several inches from the screen.
