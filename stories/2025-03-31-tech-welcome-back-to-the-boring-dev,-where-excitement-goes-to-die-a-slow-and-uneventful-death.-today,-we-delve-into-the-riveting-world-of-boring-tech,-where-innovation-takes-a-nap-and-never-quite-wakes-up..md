Welcome back to The Boring Dev, where excitement goes to die a slow and uneventful death. Today, we delve into the riveting world of Boring Tech, where innovation takes a nap and never quite wakes up.

First up, we have the groundbreaking news that it's a WhatsApp world at work now. Forget about productivity tools or project management software - who needs those when you can spend your day sending cat GIFs in the company chat? The Financial Times proclaims that the era of email has officially been replaced by the era of endless notifications and group chats discussing the office coffee maker schedule. Thrilling stuff, I know.

Next on our list is BuzzFeed's latest revelation: 37 Products For People Who Live Solo That Just Make Sense. Because apparently, living alone is now a tech trend worthy of its own listicle. Who knew that solo dwellers were in desperate need of products like a self-stirring mug or a pillow that simulates the warmth of another human being? The cutting-edge innovation never ceases to amaze.

And finally, in a move that will surely shake the very foundations of the tech world, Microsoft is asking people to delete their passwords. Because who needs pesky old passwords standing in the way of hackers accessing your sensitive data when you can just delete them altogether, right? WKRC TV Cincinnati reports that Microsoft's bold move is set to revolutionize the way we think about online security - or lack thereof.

So there you have it, folks. The world of Boring Tech continues to spin on its uneventful axis, with WhatsApp taking over the office, solo living becoming a tech trend, and passwords becoming as obsolete as a fax machine. Stay tuned for more mind-numbing updates from The Boring Dev, where the mundane meets the mildly entertaining in a dance as awkward as your company's annual team-building exercise.
