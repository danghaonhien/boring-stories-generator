Welcome back, fellow developers and design aficionados, to another thrilling edition of The Boring Dev! Today, we delve into the captivating world of Boring Design. Strap in tight, as we meander through outdated trends, design system drama, and the ever-prevalent phenomenon of designer fatigue.

Let's start with outdated trends, shall we? Ah, the nostalgic days of skeuomorphism and drop shadows galore. Remember when every button looked like it belonged in a grandmother's sewing kit? Oh, the memories. But fear not, for like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, these trends may just find their way back into our hearts. Or not.

Next up, design system drama. Ah, the never-ending battle between those who swear by atomic design and those who believe in the power of spaghetti code. It's like a soap opera, except nobody really cares who ends up with the final say on the button styles.

And finally, we come to the grand finale - designer fatigue. The struggle is real, my friends. Endless iterations, feedback that contradicts itself, and the joy of collaborating with that one stakeholder who just really loves Comic Sans. It's a rough world out there for us creative geniuses.

So there you have it, dear readers. Boring Design - a tantalizing journey through the mundanity of it all. Stay tuned for our next thrilling installment, where we explore the riveting topic of naming conventions in CSS. Try to contain your excitement. Cheers to more boring adventures ahead!
